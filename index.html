      <h1>The Genesis: Chapter Me</h1>
      <p>Aye, What it do. Im Greg, an aspiring software developer, and hardcore eater of tacos. I can down like 10 of em.</p>
      <h1>Origin</h1>
      <p>My original body was eviscerated by a particle beam on my home planet of blurph, when I stuck my face too close to get a better look at its subatomic makeup. Now im back for revenge. My body was reconstituted into my current form, in Mexico MO, as a bewildered and somewhat sickly child, who enjoyed mud and video games. As I grew up, my body threw up, and out poured exuberant ideas and fantastical imagery of a concrete world filled with lights and sour faces, where I too could be a monkey of the code. So I moved to St Louis and thats where I Be.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Hobbies include Reading, Watching stuff on the interwebz. Yes I dig the anime. I will eat me an opponents magic deck. The Gaming Gods generally frown upon me and yet I insult their very existence by refusing to leave. But I dont like walks on the beach, as im terrified of jellyfish and anyone who doesnt wear a shirt</p>
      <h1>What Will Your Ultimate Showdown Look Like?</h1>
      <p>Well much like the ultimate showdown that sweater man Mr. Rogers himself survived, except im also a Game Developer who has inovated the scene in some way. But due to my clear utter lack of creativity, and possible absence of vital sections of my frontal lobe, which Is equally clear, Ill settle for esteemed Indy developer, and creator of bacon flavored fireworks that rain real bacon, which in my opinion, too is an admirable goal.</p>
      <h1>Why do you live?</h1>
      <p>Wow Im about sick of this FAQ... Im gonna assume you meant Where do I Live, and not why. In which case, as I said earlier, St Louis. But if its the Ladder, I live to crush and devour the enemy, and assimilate them into my body, like souls in Mortal Kombat.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Mostly because I havent got the bacon fire works down yet which would be aptly name "Bacon Bangers", and hope that its not already taken by some... (AHEM)... Website. but also because it just seems like the right move for me. I've been interested in code, its Profitable, and the full stack seems like a good first step to getting into my Game ambition... But fo real do... look out for bacon bangers... dats bout to blow up... Get it?</p>
